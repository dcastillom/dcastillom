# Daniel Castillo Marfull

Just some info about me as an experiment to join Vue.js and Laravel as front and back.

## Getting Started

Clone my repo and have a look.

### Prerequisites

Some interest in Vue.js and how to create an api with Laravel.

### Installing

Clone the project

```
git clone https://github.com/dcastillom/dcastillom.git
```

In one terminal tab

```
cd front
npm install
npm run server
```

In another terminal tab

```
cd back 
npm install
php artisan migrate
php artisan serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8081
```

## Built With

* [Laravel 5.5](https://laravel.com/docs/5.5/releases) - The back part
